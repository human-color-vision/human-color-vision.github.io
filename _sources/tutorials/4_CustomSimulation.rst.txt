   <h2>The Core Steps to Designing Your Simulation</h2>

1. **Identify the Module to Customize**  
   Decide which part of the simulation you want to modify and create a new file in the corresponding directory.  

2. **Define Your Configuration**  
   Create a new YAML configuration file in the `Experiment/Config` directory. Update the `type` field to reflect your custom module.

3. **Run and Analyze**  
   Execute your simulation and analyze the results. Dive into the data to uncover new insights.
