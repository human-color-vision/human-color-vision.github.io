# Getting Started

## 1. Download the codebase

This tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on how to set up the codebase.

First, download the codebase from our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/atsu-kotani/HumanColorVision](https://github.com/atsu-kotani/HumanColorVision).

After downloading the codebase, you need to install the required packages.

## 2. Install the required packages


### Using local pip

If you are using local pip, you can install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
python -V # check the version of python (tested to work with python 3.10)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Using virtualenv

If you are using virtualenv to manage your Python environment, you can install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install virtualenv # if virtualenv is not installed
virtualenv -p python3.10 HumanColorVision # create the environment
source HumanColorVision/bin/activate # activate the environment
pip install -r requirements.txt # install the required packages
```

### Using [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install)

If you are using Conda to manage your Python environment, you can install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
conda create --name HumanColorVision python=3.10 # create the environment
conda activate HumanColorVision # activate the environment
pip install -r requirements.txt # install the required packages
```



## 3. Check installation

To check if the installation is successful, you can run the following command from the root directory of the codebase (i.e. `./HumanColorVision/`):

```bash
python check_installation.py
```

If the installation is successful, you should see the following output:

```bash
**************************************************
             Installation successful!
**************************************************
```

If you see any errors, please check the installation instructions again.


## 4. (Optional) Download the NTIRE dataset

If you wish to reproduce the results in the paper or train your own model using the hyperspectral image dataset, you will need to download the [NTIRE 2022 dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire22/).

The downloaded hyperspectral image file (e.g. `ARAD_1K_0001.mat`) should be placed under `HumanColorVision/Dataset/NTIRE2022_original/data/`.


<!-- # (Optional) 5. Download the weights of the pre-trained models

If you wish to avoid training the models from scratch, you can download the weights of the pre-trained models by running the following command from the root directory of the codebase (i.e. `./HumanColorVision/`):

```bash
cd Experiments
./download_pretrained_models.sh
```

This will populate a `LearnedWeights` folder under the `Experiments` directory with the weights of the pre-trained models.
